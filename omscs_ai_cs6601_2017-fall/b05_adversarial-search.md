* Pruning - ignore portions of the search tree that make no difference to the final choice
* Evaluation Functions - approximate the true utility of a state without doing a complete Search
* minimax value (`MINIMAX(n)`) - utility (for MAX) of being in the corresponding state, assuming that both players play optimally.
